# LinkedInDesktopApplication
In this project I was tasked with creating a desktop application that linked to an sql database for logging progress reports.

When this application first loads the user will see two buttons:
1. Start
2. Exit

The start button will take the user to the sign in page and the exit button will close the application.
When the user is taken to the sign in page they will have to enter a username which is cbrown85 and enter a password which is Passw0rd!.
After the users clicks the login button they are taken to the next page where they see a grid with timestamps, names, and posts. Below the grid is a textbox for entering the progress report. The name and timestamps are entered automatically by the applicaiton with every post. The user can also edit the post by clicking the edit button. The previous post is retrieved and placed in the textbox for editing. Once the save button is clicked the post is reentered into the databse.
